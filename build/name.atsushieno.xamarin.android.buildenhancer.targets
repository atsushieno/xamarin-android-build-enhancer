	This is specified to indicate that we use "class-parse" tool
	instead of unmaintained "jar2xml". The default in xamarin-android is
	"jar2xml" for fear of compatibility breakage. But that concern is almost
	only in theory. Xamarin.Android should make both as identical.

	This is specified to indicate that we use "improved" fast deployment
	which works like "Instant Run" in Android Studio. That is, we also
	avoid APK updates as long as possible and therefore greatly improve
	deployment speed.

	This should have been enabled in 2016 and never happened due to
	lack of interest in improving things at Xamarin.Android team.

	Note that this does not take any effect on OSS version of
	xamarin-android as there is no debugging support in it.

    <!--
	This simplifies package names in the intermediate Java code that
	xamarin-android generates.
	Before this change, you get something like `md5[some_hash].Your.Class.Name`.
	After this change, you get whatever you used in your .NET namespace,
	in lowercase.

	I find md5 hashing shitty and should have been removed, but it was
	introduced for fear of theorecal concern that .NET could bind
	two different versions of the same Java library (which should be
	broken at run-time anyways and app developers must avoid).

	I strongly suggested to default back to this `Lowercase` behavior
	but no one else was serious about it.
